## Project Title: 
#### Winter Choice Project- Game Center

## Description:
#### A collection of games that you can choose from and play against the computer. The collection contains Tic Tac Toe, Rock Paper Scissors, and Hangman(not fully developed). The program will walk you through how to play each game. 

## Dependencies:
#### Python 3, Requests module, Turtle module, and Random Module are all needed, but Repl will take care of that for you. 

## Installing:
#### The code does not need to be downloaded it just needs to be oppened in repl.it.

## Executing the Program:
#### To execute thte program you first need to have a repl.it account, then you need to use the program link to get to the program, lastly you will need to click the green 'run' button on the top middle of the screen. 

## Using the Code:
#### To begin using the code after you hit the run button you will follow the prompts at the bottom right box of the screen. To type in the input box you do have to click on it, you cannot just type. It will walk you through the games in the code.

## Common Problem:
#### Some common problems are not reding the prompt correctly, typing in an invalid answer, or not clikcing on the box to type. These can be solved by clicking on the botto right hand corner box and reading the prompt to input the answer you want.
